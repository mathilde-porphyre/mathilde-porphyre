### Hello 👋

🌱 My name is Mathilde, UX/UI designer and I'm learning to be a full-stack developer at [Becode](https://becode.org/fr/). 

🎓 I graduated from Haute École Albert Jacquard in mobile web design in 2019. 

💻 Currently looking for new professional opportunities, I have a real passion for emerging technologies.

💡 My appetite for innovation constantly drives me to explore new horizons and seek new sources of inspiration, particularly through my travels.

🔍 I pay close attention to the smallest detail, because I believe that even the smallest detail is important to the success of a project. 

👩🏻‍💻 I'm also dynamic and curious by nature.

☕️ If you'd like to learn more about my professional background or discuss potential collaborations, please get in touch! I look forward to hearing from you!
